INSTRUCTIONS
============

Write one working test that, starting from this page (https://www.justgiving.com/4w350m3/donation/direct/charity/2050), 
goes through the donation process and verifies that, after various steps, you end up on the page shown in the attached screenshot.

Please do not make an actual donation, in other words don't make your test click on the "Donate now" button in the final step.

We are interested in seeing your approach to writing well-structured, extensbile and maintainable UI tests.

Timebox this to 2.5 hours.
